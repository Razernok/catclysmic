## Available Ranks

On the server we have multiple ranks that you can <a href="https://shop.shadownode.ca/" target="_blank">contribute</a> to acquire.

The first few include some commands with many being useful and some fun ones included with a few.

Each rank also has their own custom join/leave message. 

Also, every rank inherits the commands/features from the previous ranks.
Price of each rank is also located on the <a href="https://shop.shadownode.ca/" target="_blank">shop</a> page.

{{% notice note %}}
All ranks have access to their specific prefix in `/perks`. \
Meaning if you have example eclipse rank you may use the prefix Member/Shade/Night/Equinox/Eclipse (like hide your rank or use another).
